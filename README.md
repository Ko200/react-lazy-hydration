### Hook!

> Hooks are a new feature proposal that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class. Theyâ€™re currently in React v16.8.0-alpha and being discussed in an open RFC.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useLazyHydration } from "react-lazy-hydration/hook";

import Mycomponent from "...";

function App() {
  const LazyComponent = useLazyHydration(MyComponent, {
    ssrOnly: true /*,
    whenVisible: false,
    whenIdle: false */
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <LazyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```
